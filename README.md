## Next Steps
As the research progresses, the following steps will be executed to further refine the model and extend the scope of the project:

#### Task1: Write detail about Reverse model (❌)


#### Task2: Prediction of Range and Other Aircraft Parameters using Reverse Model (❌)
- Implement a reverse prediction model that, given a target range and specific parameters like payload and V_MO, predicts missing aircraft parameters such as fuel capacity or total weight. This will allow for optimization based on desired range or operational conditions. 


#### Task3 :Review and Adjust Parameter Selection for Different Aircraft Designs and Missions: (❌)
- Reassess which parameters are necessary for different aircraft types, design requirements, and mission profiles. This includes verifying if different configurations are required for regional, long-haul, or special mission aircraft, and ensuring the model captures these nuances effectively. (Related to Task 4)


#### Task 4: Generate Simulation Data for Range Prediction and Model Training (❌) 

- Generate simulation data for aircraft ranges using various parameter configurations. Provide these configurations to the supervisor for validation and input. The next step involves using this simulation data to create more data points and train the model. Once trained, the model’s predictions will be tested by generating aircraft configurations, and tools will be used to verify if the predictions align with actual aircraft performance. This process ensures the robustness of the model and enhances its accuracy in predicting aircraft range and other key parameters.


#### Task 5: Explore Retrofits and Alternative Configurations (❌)
- Investigate how retrofits like the adoption of hydrogen fuel affect aircraft range and other parameters. For instance, analyze how a change in mass due to hydrogen fuel impacts the overall performance and range predictions. This task will focus on understanding the implications of new technologies on aircraft performance.
